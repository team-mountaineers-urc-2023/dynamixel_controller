# dynamixel_controller
Convenience library for interacting with Dynamixel XL-430 servos

## Description
This library exposes convenience functions for configuring and sending
commands to Dynamixel
[XL-430-W250-T](https://www.robotis.us/dynamixel-xl430-w250-t/) servo motors manufactured by Robotis. In the
context of the Wanderer rover, these Dynamixels are used on the science payload
for performing precise actions, such as collecting soil samples. This library
builds on top of Robotis' [Python Dynamixel
SDK](https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/DynamixelSDK).
